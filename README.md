# Mastering-Java

I have created this repo in order to have an organize place to store 
some challenges and import Java fundamentals. It is worth mention that all this 
challenges are hosted on Udemy (Java 17 Masterclass: Start Coding in 2024, by Tim Buchalka), also I am taking notes from
a book call "CORE JAVA Volume I: Fundamentals, by Cay S. Hortsmann".

## CONTENT

This repo has two main folders, the first one is Challenges where you can find all the challenges I had completed 
during the time I was taking the Udemy course and some extra taken from the book as well.

The second folder "MasterClass" contains code related with core java lessons

## DATA TYPE

As we already know, java is a strongly typed language. This means that every variable on Java must have a declared type.
There are eight primitive types in Java. Four of them are integer types; two of floating-point number types.
One is the character type Char and one is boolean type of truth values.

1. Integer Types
2. Floating-Point Types 
3. The Char Type
4. The Boolean Type

### Integer Types
The integer Types are for number without fractional parts. Negatives values are allowed
Java provides 4 integers types. 
-  **int** ; 4 bytes 
-  **short** ; 2 bytes 
-  **long** ; 8 bytes 
-  **bytes** ; 1 byte 

In most situations, the **int** type is most practical. If you want to represent the number of inhabitants of our planet, you'll need to 
resort to **long**. The byte and short type are mainly intended fo specialized applications.
